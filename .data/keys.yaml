      This is computed by the kernel during a restore, but is zeroed out during a normal boot. It is also computed by
      the Secure Bootloader, and its only known use is to decrypt LLB in NOR. Like `0x835`, it is different
      for each device.

      It is used as the encryption key for IMG2 files. With the introduction of IMG3 in iPhone OS 2.0, KBAGs are now
      used instead of the `0x837` key. Because iPhone OS versions 1.x were used only on the iPhone and iPod touch
      (both use the S5L8900) the encrypted values for other processors don't matter.

      Another UID-AES-key-based key, it is used to encrypt everything but LLB in the NOR (iBoot,
      DeviceTree, pictures).

      It is used during software upgrades on A12 and later to encrypt the "generator" value (using AES-128-CBC)
      before hashing it to become the nonce.

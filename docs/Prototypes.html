<h2 id="warning">WARNING</h2>

<p>This page discusses the designators used for various stages of Appleâ€™s production process, not internal prototypes
themselves which, unless the information has become broadly available (such as in the press) should remain treated
as an Apple trade secret.</p>

<p>You will find that un-fused devices are available through channels.  These devices are stolen and smuggled out of
Apple facilities.  While it may be broadly impossible for us to tell how knowledge was gained, by using any such
device, you run the risk of tainting this resource, promoting theft, and generally making the lawyers angry.  Please
keep to a high moral standard, avoid the temptation and ensure we can continue to have fun.</p>

<p>The SRD (or Security Research Device) is designed to be outside of Apple, but is covered by NDAs.  Any such owner of
said the device will also know their legal and moral obligations here.</p>
